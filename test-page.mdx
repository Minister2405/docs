**1. Detect code changes that require documentation updates**

Whenever you ship, no matter how big or small, the agent reviews the changed files and identifies suggestions for what needs to be updated and reflected in your docs.

**2. Surface the updates**

In the agent panel, you’ll see exactly which PRs introduced changes that may require documentation. This means no more guessing, no more hunting information, no more asking your teammates “who knows how this works?”

**3. Generate documentation drafts**

With full context of your codebase and your existing documentation structure and tone, the agent creates a draft that you can iterate on, refine, and generate a PR.

It keeps a human in the loop while automating your workflow, so you can stay ahead and publish docs as quickly as you ship products.
